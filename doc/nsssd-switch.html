<h1> The nsssd-switch program </h1>

<p>
<tt>nsssd-switch</tt> is a daemon providing a backend for clients using the
<a href="libnsss/">nsss library</a> - more precisely, clients using
the <a href="libnsss/nsss-all.html">nsss-all</a> or
the <a href="libnsss/nsss-switch.html">nsss-switch</a> functions.
</p>

<p>
 The <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> backend is the real point of the <a href="index.html">nsss</a>
package: it allows a complex configuration using different other backends,
similarly to the <a href="nsswitch.html">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a> mechanism
but without its drawbacks. It accomplishes this by reading its backend
configuration on the command line.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-ipcserver -l0 /run/service/nsssd/s nsssd-switch [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>bitfield1</em> <em>backend1...</em> "" <em>bitfield2</em> <em>backend2...</em> "" ...
</pre>

<p>
 or, in an <a href="//skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> script:
</p>

<pre>
     s6-ipcserver -l0 /run/service/nsssd/s
     nsssd-switch
       <em>bitfield1</em> { <em>backend1...</em> }
       <em>bitfield2</em> { <em>backend2...</em> }
       ...
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> is normally spawned by a super-server like
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a>.
There is one instance of <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> per client connection. </li>
 <li> <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> interprets its command line as a script that
configures all its backends. The script is a series of directives:
  <ol>
   <li> First a <em>bitfield</em> is read: it's a number between 0 and 7.
This number determines how the backend will behave in case of failure. </li>
   <li> Then a <em>backend</em> is read: it is a full command-line, terminated
by an empty word. (In an <a href="//skarnet.org/software/execline/execlineb.html">execline</a>
script, the <em>backend</em> is a block, without the empty word.) The command
line is an implementation of the server side of the nsss protocol: for instance,
<tt>nsssd-unix ""</tt> declares a Unix backend with user, group and shadow
credentials in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, <tt>/etc/group</tt> and <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>.
</li>
  </ol> </li>
 <li> <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> spawns all its declared backends. </li>
 <li> It then reads queries from its client. It transmits every query to
its backends, in the order given on the command line. A success means
that the answer is immediately returned to the client, and no further
backend is contacted. A failure can be handled in different ways, depending
on the type of failure and on the <em>bitfield</em> associated to the
<em>backend</em>. </li>
 <li> <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> (and all the backends it spawned) exits when
the client connection is closed, or in some cases, after a timeout. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<p>
 These exit codes are not important because only the super-server can see them.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> 0: normal exit or timeout while waiting for a client query </li>
 <li> 100: wrong usage </li>
 <li> 111: system call failed or timeout during a nsss protocol exchange </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>timeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: enforce a limit of
<em>timeout</em> milliseconds when communicating with a backend. If a
backend fails to answer a query under <em>timeout</em> milliseconds,
<tt>nsssd-switch</tt> will return a failure code to the client, and
the backend will be considered permanently failed. The default is 0,
meaning no such timeout - backends can take as much time as they want
to answer queries. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Environment variables </h2>

<p>
 <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> can read a number <em>x</em> in the NSSSD_TIMEOUT
environment variable. If this variable is present and valid, it means that
<tt>nsssd-switch</tt> will die if <em>x</em> milliseconds elapse without
the client reading or writing during a nsss protocol exchange, which usually
means the client either is not speaking the protocol correctly or has become
unresponsive. It is a safety measure to avoid having <tt>nsssd</tt> processes
sticking around forever when a client is buggy.
</p>

<p>
 Note that the NSSSD_TIMEOUT variable refers to a timeout during an exchange
with the <em>client</em>, while the argument to the <tt>-t</tt> option refers
to a timeout enforced on the <em>backends</em>.
</p>

<h2> Bitfields </h2>

<p>
 A <em>bitfield</em> is a value between 0 and 7, representing 3 bits. If a
bit is 0, it means that the query resolution will <em>continue to the next
backend</em> if the corresponding failure condition is triggered. If the
bit is 1, it means that the failure will instantly be reported to the client
and the query will not be transmitted to the next backend in the chain.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Bit 0: the backend is in a state of permanent failure: it failed to start,
it crashed, or it timed out. </li>
 <li> Bit 1: the backend answered the query with a failure. </li>
 <li> Bit 2: the requested entry was not found in the backend's database. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 So, for instance, a bitfield of 5 means: report failure to the client if the
current backend is in a failed state or if a requested entry cannot be found.
Proceed to the next backend if the current backend reports failure when
processing a query.
</p>

<p>
 This format allows the administrator to configure various fallback strategies.
Note that in case of success, the requested data is immediately returned to the
client. <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> does not provide the equivalent of the <tt>merge</tt>
directive in <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt>.
</p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
<li>
 <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> is not meant to be called directly; instead, it is expected to be run from
a script as a part of a "nsssd"
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/localservice.html">local service</a>.
</li>

<li>
 The <tt>examples/</tt> subdirectory of the nsss package provides examples
on how to run such a service.
 The simplest way to do so, for testing purposes, is a command line such as:
<code>s6-ipcserver -l0 /run/service/nsssd/s nsssd-switch 0 nsssd-unix "" </code>
</li>

<li>
<tt>/run/service/nsssd/s</tt> is the default place where nsss's
implementation of the <tt>pwd.h</tt>, <tt>grp.h</tt> and <tt>shadow.h</tt>
functions expects the nsssd
service to be. It can be changed at nsss build time by giving the
<tt>--with-nsssd-socket=PATH</tt> option to configure.
</li>

<li>
 <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> does not listen to the socket itself: it reads from its
standard input and writes to its standard output. It relies
on a superserver such as
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a>
to manage connections to the socket. An instance of nsssd-switch is run
for every client connection.
</li>

<li>
 If fine-grained authorizations are required (only allowing
certain users and groups to connect to the service), the superserver
can be configured to enforce them.
</li>

<li>
 <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> does not need to run as root, provided it has all the
permissions needed by the backends it spawns.
It is recommended to create a <em>nsss</em> user and group, dedicated to
the nsssd service, and run the superserver as this user and group.
</li>

<li>
 <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> is limited to 8 backends. If you need more, you can
chain another <tt>nsssd-switch</tt> invocation as the 8th backend,
which gives you another batch of 8.
</li>
