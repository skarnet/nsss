<h1> The nsssd-nslcd program </h1>

<p>
nsssd-nslcd is a daemon providing a backend for clients using the
<a href="libnsss/">nsss library</a> - more precisely, clients using
the <a href="libnsss/nsss-all.html">nsss-all</a> or
the <a href="libnsss/nsss-switch.html">nsss-switch</a> functions.
</p>

<p>
 The nsssd-nslcd backend is meant to be used when the user/group/shadow
information is held in a LDAP server, and the
<a href="https://github.com/arthurdejong/nss-pam-ldapd/tree/master/nslcd">nslcd</a>
daemon is running on the system as an interface to the LDAP architecture.
nsssd-nslcd acts a server for its libnsss-using client, and as a
client to nslcd. It forwards the application's requests to nslcd, and
forwards the answers back.
</p>

<p>
 nsssd-nslcd is not meant to be called directly; instead, it is expected to be run from
a script as a part of a "nsssd"
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/localservice.html">local service</a>.
</p>

<p>
 The <tt>examples/</tt> subdirectory of the nsss package provides examples
on how to run such a service.
 The simplest way to do so, for testing purposes, is a command line such as:
</p>
<pre>s6-ipcserver -l0 /run/service/nsssd/s nsssd-nslcd /var/run/nslcd/socket</pre>

<p>
<tt>/run/service/nsssd/s</tt> is the default place where nsss's
implementation of the <tt>pwd.h</tt>, <tt>grp.h</tt> and <tt>shadow.h</tt>
functions expects the nsssd
service to be. It can be changed at nsss build time by giving the
<tt>--with-nsssd-socket=PATH</tt> option to configure.
nsssd-nslcd takes one argument: the path to connect to the nslcd daemon.
By default, this is <tt>/var/run/nslcd/socket</tt>. The default can be
changed at nslcd build time.
</p>

<p>
 nsssd-nslcd does not listen to the socket itself: it reads from its
standard input and writes to its standard output. It relies
on a superserver such as
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a>
to manage connections to the socket. An instance of nsssd-nslcd is run
for every client connection.
</p>

<p>
 If fine-grained authorizations are required (only allowing
certain users and groups to connect to the service), the superserver
can be configured to enforce them.
</p>

<p>
 nsssd-nslcd does not need to run as root, provided it can connect
to the nslcd daemon.
It is recommended to create a <em>nsss</em> user and group, dedicated to
the nsssd service, and run the superserver as this user and group.
