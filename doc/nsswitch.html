<h1> The problem with nsswitch </h1>

<p>
 <em>nsswitch</em>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch">Name
Service Switch</a>, is a common Unix mechanism to describe how
user/group/shadow databases should be accessed. Nowadays it's
prevalent on Linux because it's the mechanism used by the glibc.
</p>

<p>
 Unfortunately, <em>nsswitch</em> has a certain number of flaws
that make it difficult to use in a small and secure environment.
In other words, it's crap. Here's why.
</p>

<h2> <em>nsswitch</em> uses dynamically linked modules. </h2>

<p>
 <em>nsswitch</em> works by reading a configuration file,
<tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt>, and depending on what it reads in this
file, loading one or more shared libraries, via
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/dlopen.html">dlopen()</a>,
into the application. These shared libraries, for instance
<tt>/lib/libnss_files-2.19.so</tt>, are provided by the NSS implementation
(glibc on Linux). This mechanism has drawbacks.
</p>

<h3> It makes it difficult to link programs statically. </h3>

<p>
 Programs using <tt>dlopen()</tt> are notoriously difficult to use
in a static linking environment: by nature, <tt>dlopen()</tt> is
dynamic, and it's practically impossible to make it work reliably
and correctly in statically linked programs.
</p>

<p>
 So, small programs that just need a <tt>getpwnam()</tt> call
cannot, for all intents and purposes, be linked statically when
the implementation of <tt>getpwnam()</tt> goes through <em>nsswitch</em>.
</p>

<p>
 By contrast, the <em>nsss</em> implementation of <tt>getpwnam()</tt>
works with static linking without trouble, and without pulling the
whole libc - only the <em>nsss</em> client library is pulled, and
it is quite small.
</p>

<h3> It dynamically adds third-party code to the process' address space. </h3>

<p>
 This is a common security issue with dynamically loaded modules.
</p>

<p>
 Normally, when you link your executable against a third-party library -
in this case, the libc - the library has a public API that you're using,
and that API has documented behaviour. Some sanity checks are performed
at link time, and if something is terribly wrong, linking fails.
</p>

<p>
 This is not the case with dynamically loaded modules used internally
by a library. These modules do not have a contract with you, the application
developer, but only with the library that uses them. Some checks are
performed at <em>library build time</em>, but not at <em>application
build time</em>. When <tt>dlopen()</tt> is run, it performs some
minimal checks <em>at run-time</em> (which is the worst time for checks,
because failure causes application downtime!), then loads code and data
into your application's address space without ever having verified that
the interaction is okay.
</p>

<p>
 It would be extremely easy for a malicious third-party to inject
subtly bad code making your application behave in unintended ways
using dynamically loaded modules. And even from benevolent library
authors, it makes bugs more subtle and harder to catch.
</p>

<p>
 By contrast, <em>nsss</em> doesn't load its backends into the client's
address space - only the fallback <em>nsss-unix</em> implementation
using <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> is linked client-side, and there's even an
option to disable that. All the complex backend code lives server-side
in the appropriate <em>nsssd</em> daemon, sharing no address space with
the application.
</p>

<h2> <em>nsswitch</em> adds a configuration parser and a decision
automaton to the application. </h2>

<p>
 <em>nsswitch</em>'s configuration is done via the
<tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file, a text, human-friendly file.
The first time a user database function is called, the file is read and
parsed, and then for all subsequent user database function calls, a
decision automaton (that results from this parsing) is run so the
engine knows which sequence of backends to call in which situation.
</p>

<p>
 All this, obviously, happens at run-time, in the application's
address space. Maybe it's time for a quick reminder that
</p>

<ul>
 <li> parsing is bad - most people can't write parsers, and bugs love them
(both the parsers and these people) </li>
 <li> run-time is the worst time for syntax errors, and any other
errors that could and should be caught <em>earlier</em> </li>
 <li> library code should be kept as simple as possible and a dynamic
decision automaton doesn't qualify as "simple" </li>
 <li> every line of code linked into a critical application (such
as <tt>login</tt>) is attack surface </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The <em>nsswitch</em> configuration model goes against all these basic
programming principles.
</p>

<p>
 By contrast, <em>nsss</em>:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> performs no parsing at all - and if a generic backend ever needs
parsing, it will be done in its own process address space, not in the
application's. </li>
 <li> has the simplest possible decision engine: "if contacting the
backend fails, fall back on the Unix mechanism". And even that can be
overridden at application build time. If a more complex decision engine
is needed, it can be implemented, say it with me, in a backend that has
its own address space. </li>
 <li> frontloads as many decisions as possible before application run
time. The backend used by applications is determined when the
<em>nsssd</em> service starts, and can be changed by modifying and
restarting this service; the burden of determining which backend to
run is not carried by applications. </li>
</ul>
