nsssd - a secure NSS-like implementation for small libcs
--------------------------------------------------------

 nsss is a library implementing a subset of pwd.h, group.h
and shadow.h family of functions - the subset that can use a
different backend than the standard /etc/passwd (et al.) files.
It is intended to be used with certain libcs, such as musl, that
do not implement the NSS protocol and so do not allow user/group
credentials to be stored in other databases.

 Unlike NSS, nsss does not load dynamic modules and is fully
compatible with static linking. The backend is chosen at boot time
by running the appropriate daemon that will communicate with
clients.
